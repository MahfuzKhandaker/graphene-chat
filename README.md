Chat application backend build with GraphQL and Django

## What Is GraphQL
### A query language for your API
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. 

In a nutshell, GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data, and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. 

In practice, a GraphQL API is organized around three main building blocks: the schema, queries, and resolvers.

## Why use GraphQL?
### Ask for what you need, get exactly that
Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less.
### Get many resources in a single request
GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.

There is no doubt that REST gets the job done, but if youâ€™re at a point where you need a better way to build APIs and serve diverse clients, then you should probably give GraphQL a try.
